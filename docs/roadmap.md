# Roadmap — dashboard-android

Native Android companion for the self-hosted dashboard's Phase 11 widget API
(`/api/widget/v1`). Contract verified against the dashboard server at
`a735a189766ea914baae435b42db7ae6583b562a` (origin/main). See
[`api-contract.md`](api-contract.md) and [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

## Status

| Slice | State | Commit |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 — Scaffold: domain/DTO/mappers, API client (Retrofit + fake), Room cache, EncryptedSharedPreferences settings, Compose Today/Capture/Settings, Glance widget, WorkManager refresh | ✅ done | `d5979a8` |
| 2 — QA fixes: settings save/test race, base-URL validation/no-crash, enriched `/focus/start` + `/capture` + `/chat` responses, doc accuracy | ✅ done | `8dbde6a` |
| 3 — Connection hardening: read-only `testConnection()` probe (no cache/server mutation), resume-driven Today refresh (tab return + app foreground), widget refresh after in-app capture, `dwtk_` token hint, friendly auth/URL/network errors | ✅ done | `bc9e129` |

**Build/verification gate:** authored in an environment with **no JDK / Gradle /
Android SDK**, so nothing has been compiled or run. JVM unit tests are written and
ready (`PayloadMappingTest`, `RepositoryTest`, `BaseUrlNormalizationTest`,
`DeviceTokenFormatTest`). First real run must: open in Android Studio → sync →
`./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` → `assembleDebug`, resolving any AGP/Kotlin/
Compose-BOM version skew the local SDK surfaces. See README "Verification status".

## Next (not yet built)

- **Real-device verification** — run the JVM tests, build, install; exercise the
  Glance widget actions (habit toggle, focus start) and WorkManager refresh on a
  device against a live dashboard over the Tailscale HTTPS URL. Highest priority.
- **Tasks screen** — a dedicated list beyond Today's single `mainAction`
  (intentionally trimmed for V1).
- **Lock-screen / widget quote UI** — `QuotePayload` + `/quote` are wired in the
  client; no surface renders them yet.
- **Focus countdown** — `FocusStartResult.session.fireAt` (epoch seconds) is
  decoded and preserved but not surfaced as an in-app/in-widget timer.
- **In-app device-token mint/revoke** — currently done in the dashboard web UI
  (Settings → Devices) and pasted in; revisit if an in-app flow is wanted.
- **Widget immediacy when offline** — in-app capture refreshes the widget from
  cache only when online (capture requires network); otherwise it catches up on
  the next periodic worker.

## Known risks

- Contract is pinned to dashboard `a735a18`; a server payload change is localized
  to `data/api/dto` + `PayloadMappingTest` by the lenient decoder and the
  `version`/`/v1` pinning.
- Runtime-unverified paths: Glance composition/actions, WorkManager scheduling,
  `LifecycleResumeEffect` refresh, EncryptedSharedPreferences on older OEM ROMs.
